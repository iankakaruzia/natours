## CHALLENGES

### API

- Implement restriction that users can only review a tour **that they have actually booked**.
- Implement nested **booking** routes: `/tours/:id/bookings` and `/users/:id/bookings`.
- **Improve tour dates**: add a `participants` and a `soldOut` field to each date. A date the becomes like an instance of the tour. Then, when a user books, they need to select one of the dates. A new booking will increase the number of participants in the date, until it is booked out (_participants > maxGroupSize_). So, when a user wants to book, you need to check if tour on the selected date is still available.
- Implement **advanced authentication features**: confirm user email, keep users logged in with refresh tokens, two-factor authentication, etc.

### Site

- On the tour detail page, if user has taken a tour, allow them **add a review directly on the website**. Implement a form for this.
- **Hide the entire booking section** on the tour detail page if current user has already booked the tour.
- **Implement "like tour" functionality**, with favorite tour page.
- On the user account page, implement the **My Reviews** page, where all reviews are displayed, and a user can edit them.
- For Administrators, implement all the **Manage**Â pages, where they can CRUD tours, users, reviews and bookings.
